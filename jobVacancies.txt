Introduction At IBM, work is more than a job - it's a calling: To build. To design. To code. To consult. To think along with clients and sell. To make markets. To invent. To collaborate. Not just to do something better, but to attempt things you've never thought possible. Are you ready to lead in this new era of technology and solve some of the world's most challenging problems? If so, lets talk.  Your Role and Responsibilities As a Software Developer with the MultiCloud SaaS Platform, you will be involved in multiple areas of the software development project, which is currently staffed and already in place (back-end devs, front end devs, DevOps). Prior hands-on experience in developing and testing Cloud-based applications and API/microservices would be advantageous. Exposure and experience with IBM Cloud, ROKS, Security and Networking, and Telemetry would stand you out from the rest.  You may be involved in all areas of the Platform, from developing new features and functions, to ensuring the production environment remains stable and reliable.  The developer and Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) teams both care about reliability, availability, performance, scalability, efficiency, and feature and launch velocity.

SREs are responsible for ensuring services are resilient, responsive and have an up time appropriate to customer’s needs whilst controlling capacity and performance. Additionally, improving these services in a highly dynamic environment. In summary, SRE is an engineering discipline that combines software, infrastructure and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant systems. Day-to-day, SREs use automation to limit time spent on operational work and proactively identify potential risk factors and convert them into actionable improvements  Whichever squad you join, the overall approach will be to: Analyse the requirements and prepare plans, code, and test to ensure quality deliverables within the multiple-geo Platform team. Develop automation tests for the test cases executed & maintain existing regression suite. Take ownership of the entire development lifecycle including documentation, testing, and maintenance. Participate in sprint planning and other agile ceremonies.

Company Description  Arista Networks is the leader in software driven networking solutions for today’s largest Data Center (DC), Cloud, Internet/WAN, Service Provider (SP) and Campus environments. Arista has over 7500 customers ranging from the largest cloud providers, to healthcare, government, carrier, finance, education, and production web/SaaS companies. Arista's products are the foundation underpinning much of modern society's operations.  Arista has ambitious plans and an unprecedented opportunity for growth and we are looking for many more engineers and designers to join us in building and innovating the world's networks. Arista is a profitable, publicly quoted company with revenues of over $2B with a culture of invention, quality, respect, and fun.  One of the many attractions of joining Arista is that right from the top, Arista is an engineering company. The founders and engineering managers are all engineers who understand good software engineering and the importance of doing things right.  Our management structure is flat and lightweight. Software engineering is run by software engineers who are in charge of delivering features from concept through to completion. We put a premium on building quality software and using automated testing. No part of the company is off-limits, meaning that our engineers have the chance to work in many different areas over time.  Arista today is one of the fastest-growing companies in the industry. Arista has disrupted the market with two significant innovations: * Arista’s principle invention is an advanced network operating system, Arista EOS® (Extensible Operating System). Based on open standards, delivering high reliability and unique programmability at all system levels and offering a data-driven network platform that automates IT workflows, provides network-wide visibility, and enables rapid problem resolution. Arista’s other key innovation is the exclusive use of best-in-class merchant silicon that enables open standards-based networking with rapid time-to-market. Notably, Arista’s merchant silicon strategy delivers state-of-the-art platforms at a faster time to market enabled by technology advances associated with Moore’s Law. In contrast, legacy approaches are built on custom ASICs coupled with monolithic software resulting in proprietary platforms and increased costs. Arista’s engineering team started from a blank sheet of paper to architect an entirely new networking operating system. Arista’s unique architecture is based on three guiding principles: * State orientation Open standards-based approach Single software image consistency 1) State Orientation for publish-subscribe communication  State Orientation uses a unique multi-process state-sharing architecture that separates state information from protocol processing and application logic with a central database shared by diverse applications. Both system state and data are stored in the system database where data is accessed via an automated publish/subscribe model. This distinct design principle provides module independence, self-healing resiliency, and multi-process software stability. It is an elegant distributed systems solution applied holistically right across the network.  This contrasts with the decades-old legacy approach of many competitors that uses extensive inter-process communications (IPC), a shared memory bus, or a complex message passing framework to communicate across the system components.  2) An Open Approach  Arista took to heart the lessons of the open-source world and built EOS on top of an unmodified Linux kernel, maintaining full, secured access to the Linux shell and utilities. It is notable that it is the same Linux OS that Arista’s customers run in their data centers and on their servers. This foundational methodology enables EOS to preserve the security, feature development, and tools of the Linux community, unlike legacy approaches where the original OS kernel is either modified or based on older, less maintained versions. By adhering to open source Linux, EOS also natively supports Linux containers and virtual machines, simplifying the deployment of new services and enhancing DevOps practices.  3) A Single Image  Arista’s third and crucial guiding principle is to provide a single software image that runs across all products in various packaging forms - physical platforms, virtual machines, and containers. The EOS single image uses the same source code, and the same version of the software released across the entire portfolio of switches and routers, thus improving network testing and reliability while reducing the complexity and cost of network operations.  This approach is a large differentiator to legacy vendors who use multiple operating systems with numerous images to implement a siloed network. Managing these multiple software images with quality control testing or new features testing multiplies operational costs. In contrast, when Arista releases a new software version, customers merely deploy a single image network-wide.  In addition, having a single image improves automation workflows by allowing DevOps tools, such as Ansible or Terraform, to work across all Arista devices with a single integration. Using these integrations, operators can establish Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines that build, test, and deploy network configurations across the entire data center with increased speed and reliability.  Job Description  We are building disruptive products and services that deliver highly automated networks that interconnect and secure connectivity between various global locations. As a part of the team you will be exposed to wide variety of technologies like EOS (Extensible Operating System), multithreading, multicore software forwarding based on DPDK, public cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) infrastructure, Path selection, NFV, Containers, Network Segmentation, Virtualization, microservice based architectures, CI/CD pipelines, and Terraform-based declarative provisioning models. As a core member of the CloudEOS team, you will be part of a fast paced, high-caliber team building cutting edge software products for Cloud-enabled WAN connectivity. The team is responsible for all aspects of the development and delivery of control plane, software data plane, and management platform/APIs/services.  Qualifications  Basic qualifications Bachelor's/Master's degree in Engineering 3+ years of experience working as a Systems Software Development Engineer Proficiency in C/C++ programming language Software Development experience with Linux Strong communication skills and the ability to work in a team environment Preferred qualifications Experience with DPDK, Software Forwarding, DPI based application recognition Experience with Qos and secure communication using IPSec Python and/or Golang development experience Experience working through the complete software development life cycle right from requirements gathering to delivering the fully developed feature. Strong software debugging skills especially in embedded systems. Experience in Network Systems Software development is a plus Additional Information  Hiring in Locations: Dublin Ireland, Kraków Poland, Bucharest Romania, Budapest Hungary, Athens Greece, Istanbul Turkey.  All your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines. Arista Networks

Company Description  Arista Networks is the leader in software driven networking solutions for today’s largest Data Center (DC), Cloud, Internet/WAN, Service Provider (SP) and Campus environments. Arista has over 7500 customers ranging from the largest cloud providers, to healthcare, government, carrier, finance, education, and production web/SaaS companies. Arista's products are the foundation underpinning much of modern society's operations.  Arista has ambitious plans and an unprecedented opportunity for growth and we are looking for many more engineers and designers to join us in building and innovating the world's networks. Arista is a profitable, publicly quoted company with revenues of over $2B with a culture of invention, quality, respect, and fun.  Job Description  Arista today is one of the fastest-growing companies in the industry. Arista has disrupted the market with two significant innovations: * Arista’s principle invention is an advanced network operating system, Arista EOS® (Extensible Operating System). Based on open standards, delivering high reliability and unique programmability at all system levels and offering a data-driven network platform that automates IT workflows, provides network-wide visibility, and enables rapid problem resolution. Arista’s other key innovation is the exclusive use of best-in-class merchant silicon that enables open standards-based networking with rapid time-to-market. Notably, Arista’s merchant silicon strategy delivers state-of-the-art platforms at a faster time to market enabled by technology advances associated with Moore’s Law. In contrast, legacy approaches are built on custom ASICs coupled with monolithic software resulting in proprietary platforms and increased costs. Arista’s engineering team started from a blank sheet of paper to architect an entirely new networking operating system. Arista’s unique architecture is based on three guiding principles: * State orientation Open standards-based approach Single software image consistency 1) State Orientation for publish-subscribe communication  State Orientation uses a unique multi-process state-sharing architecture that separates state information from protocol processing and application logic with a central database shared by diverse applications. Both system state and data are stored in the system database where data is accessed via an automated publish/subscribe model. This distinct design principle provides module independence, self-healing resiliency, and multi-process software stability. It is an elegant distributed systems solution applied holistically right across the network.  This contrasts with the decades-old legacy approach of many competitors that uses extensive inter-process communications (IPC), a shared memory bus, or a complex message passing framework to communicate across the system components.  2) An Open Approach  Arista took to heart the lessons of the open-source world and built EOS on top of an unmodified Linux kernel, maintaining full, secured access to the Linux shell and utilities. It is notable that it is the same Linux OS that Arista’s customers run in their data centers and on their servers. This foundational methodology enables EOS to preserve the security, feature development, and tools of the Linux community, unlike legacy approaches where the original OS kernel is either modified or based on older, less maintained versions. By adhering to open source Linux, EOS also natively supports Linux containers and virtual machines, simplifying the deployment of new services and enhancing DevOps practices.  3) A Single Image  Arista’s third and crucial guiding principle is to provide a single software image that runs across all products in various packaging forms - physical platforms, virtual machines, and containers. The EOS single image uses the same source code, and the same version of the software released across the entire portfolio of switches and routers, thus improving network testing and reliability while reducing the complexity and cost of network operations.  This approach is a large differentiator to legacy vendors who use multiple operating systems with numerous images to implement a siloed network. Managing these multiple software images with quality control testing or new features testing multiplies operational costs. In contrast, when Arista releases a new software version, customers merely deploy a single image network-wide.  In addition, having a single image improves automation workflows by allowing DevOps tools, such as Ansible or Terraform, to work across all Arista devices with a single integration. Using these integrations, operators can establish Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines that build, test, and deploy network configurations across the entire data center with increased speed and reliability.  Qualifications Strong engineering and Computer Science fundamentals. Extensive background in algorithms and strong software architecture skills. Fluency in one of C/C++/Python programming. Hands-on experience with designs and implementations in a strong product-engineering environment. Additional Information  All your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines.

Company Description  Arista Networks is the leader in software driven networking solutions for today's largest Data Center (DC), Cloud, Internet/WAN, Service Provider (SP) and Campus environments. Arista has over 7500 customers ranging from the largest cloud providers, to healthcare, government, carrier, finance, education, and production web/SaaS companies. Arista's products are the foundation underpinning much of modern society's operations.  Arista has ambitious plans and an unprecedented opportunity for growth and we are looking for many more engineers and designers to join us in building and innovating the world's networks. Arista is a profitable, publicly quoted company with revenues of over $2B with a culture of invention, quality, respect, and fun.  One of the many attractions of joining Arista is that right from the top, Arista is an engineering company. The founders and engineering managers are all engineers who understand good software engineering and the importance of doing things right.  Our management structure is flat and lightweight. Software engineering is run by software engineers who are in charge of delivering features from concept through to completion. We put a premium on building quality software and using automated testing. No part of the company is off-limits, meaning that our engineers have the chance to work in many different areas over time.  Arista today is one of the fastest-growing companies in the industry. Arista has disrupted the market with two significant innovations: * Arista's principle invention is an advanced network operating system, Arista EOS® (Extensible Operating System). Based on open standards, delivering high reliability and unique programmability at all system levels and offering a data-driven network platform that automates IT workflows, provides network-wide visibility, and enables rapid problem resolution. Arista's other key innovation is the exclusive use of best-in-class merchant silicon that enables open standards-based networking with rapid time-to-market. Notably, Arista's merchant silicon strategy delivers state-of-the-art platforms at a faster time to market enabled by technology advances associated with Moore's Law. In contrast, legacy approaches are built on custom ASICs coupled with monolithic software resulting in proprietary platforms and increased costs. Arista's engineering team started from a blank sheet of paper to architect an entirely new networking operating system. Arista's unique architecture is based on three guiding principles: * State orientation Open standards-based approach Single software image consistency 1) State Orientation for publish-subscribe communication  State Orientation uses a unique multi-process state-sharing architecture that separates state information from protocol processing and application logic with a central database shared by diverse applications. Both system state and data are stored in the system database where data is accessed via an automated publish/subscribe model. This distinct design principle provides module independence, self-healing resiliency, and multi-process software stability. It is an elegant distributed systems solution applied holistically right across the network.  This contrasts with the decades-old legacy approach of many competitors that uses extensive inter-process communications (IPC), a shared memory bus, or a complex message passing framework to communicate across the system components.  2) An Open Approach  Arista took to heart the lessons of the open-source world and built EOS on top of an unmodified Linux kernel, maintaining full, secured access to the Linux shell and utilities. It is notable that it is the same Linux OS that Arista's customers run in their data centers and on their servers. This foundational methodology enables EOS to preserve the security, feature development, and tools of the Linux community, unlike legacy approaches where the original OS kernel is either modified or based on older, less maintained versions. By adhering to open source Linux, EOS also natively supports Linux containers and virtual machines, simplifying the deployment of new services and enhancing DevOps practices.  3) A Single Image  Arista's third and crucial guiding principle is to provide a single software image that runs across all products in various packaging forms - physical platforms, virtual machines, and containers. The EOS single image uses the same source code, and the same version of the software released across the entire portfolio of switches and routers, thus improving network testing and reliability while reducing the complexity and cost of network operations.  This approach is a large differentiator to legacy vendors who use multiple operating systems with numerous images to implement a siloed network. Managing these multiple software images with quality control testing or new features testing multiplies operational costs. In contrast, when Arista releases a new software version, customers merely deploy a single image network-wide.  In addition, having a single image improves automation workflows by allowing DevOps tools, such as Ansible or Terraform, to work across all Arista devices with a single integration. Using these integrations, operators can establish Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines that build, test, and deploy network configurations across the entire data center with increased speed and reliability.  Job Description  We are building disruptive products and services that deliver highly automated networks that interconnect and secure connectivity between various global locations. As a part of the team you will be exposed to wide variety of technologies like EOS (Extensible Operating System), multithreading, multicore software forwarding based on DPDK, public cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) infrastructure, Path selection, NFV, Containers, Network Segmentation, Virtualization, microservice based architectures, CI/CD pipelines, and Terraform-based declarative provisioning models. As a core member of the CloudEOS team, you will be part of a fast paced, high-caliber team building cutting edge software products for Cloud-enabled WAN connectivity. The team is responsible for all aspects of the development and delivery of control plane, software data plane, and management platform/APIs/services.  Qualifications  Basic qualifications Bachelor's/Master's degree in Engineering 3+ years of experience working as a Systems Software Development Engineer Proficiency in C/C++ programming language Software Development experience with Linux Strong communication skills and the ability to work in a team environment Preferred qualifications Experience with DPDK, Software Forwarding, DPI based application recognition Experience with Qos and secure communication using IPSec Python and/or Golang development experience Experience working through the complete software development life cycle right from requirements gathering to delivering the fully developed feature. Strong software debugging skills especially in embedded systems. Experience in Network Systems Software development is a plus Additional Information  Hiring in Locations: Dublin Ireland, Kraków Poland, Bucharest Romania, Budapest Hungary, Athens Greece, Istanbul Turkey.  All your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines. Arista Networks
